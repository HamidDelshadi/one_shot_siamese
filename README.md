# one_shot_siamese
Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition

The main project is contained in OneShotHMM.ipynb<br>
Data pre-processing and augmentation is done in Augmentation.ipynb<br>
aug.zip contains the augmented dataset.<br>
data_cleaner.ipynb contains a data cleaner algorithm for splitting test dataset images into different objects.<br>
new_data.zip is the cleaned test data.<br>

All code files should be run in Google Colab.
