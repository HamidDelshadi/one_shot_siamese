# one_shot_siamese
Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition

The main project is contained in OneShotHMM.ipynb
Data pre-processing and augmentation is done in Augmentation.ipynb
aug.zip contains the augmented dataset.
data_cleaner.ipynb contains a data cleaner algorithm for splitting test dataset images into different objects.
new_data.zip is the cleaned test data.

All code files should be run in Google Colab.
